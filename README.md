This project explores fuel economy trends using the mpg dataset from Seaborn. It includes visualizations and statistical summaries to analyze how fuel efficiency varies based on factors like horsepower, country of origin, and model year.

*Horsepower vs. Fuel Economy: Analyzes how horsepower affects MPG.
*Fuel Economy by Country: Summarizes fuel efficiency by country of origin.
*Fuel Economy Over Time: Tracks changes in MPG across model years.
*Additional Visuals & Tables: Further breakdowns of fuel efficiency trends.
